  # Add status tracking for project objectives

  1. Changes
    - Project objectives can now have individual status tracking (draft/submitted)
    - This allows managers to save objectives as drafts before finalizing them
    - Employees only see finalized objectives, managers can see all statuses

  2. Implementation
    - Status is stored within the objectives JSON structure
    - No database schema changes needed as we use the existing JSONB field
    - Application logic handles the status filtering
*/

-- This migration serves as documentation for the project objectives status feature
-- The actual implementation is handled in the application layer using the existing
-- objectifs JSONB field in the objectifs_collaborateurs table

-- No database changes needed as we store status within the JSON structure
