/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in user_profiles RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current policies create circular dependencies by querying user_profiles within user_profiles policies
    - This causes infinite recursion when trying to fetch user data

  2. Solution
    - Simplify policies to avoid self-referencing queries
    - Use direct auth functions instead of EXISTS queries on user_profiles
    - Create a separate function to check user roles safely

  3. Changes
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create new simplified policies
    - Add a safe role checking function
*/

-- First, drop all existing policies that cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow trigger to create profiles" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable automatic profile creation" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "HR and admin can update profiles" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "HR and admin roles can read all profiles" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Managers can read their team profiles" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read their manager's profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON user_profiles;

-- Create a safe function to get current user role without recursion
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_current_user_role()
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE SQL
SECURITY DEFINER
STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT role FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1;
$$;

-- Create simplified, non-recursive policies

-- Allow users to read their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE

-- Allow users to create their own profile (for initial setup)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own profile"
  ON user_profiles

-- Allow public access for profile creation (needed for triggers)
CREATE POLICY "Enable profile creation"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO public
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow managers to read their team profiles (simplified)
CREATE POLICY "Managers can read team profiles"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated

-- Allow users to read their manager's profile (simplified)
CREATE POLICY "Users can read manager profile"

  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (

-- Create a separate policy for admin/HR access using a simpler approach
-- This will be handled by checking the role in the application layer initially
-- to avoid recursion, then we can add more complex policies later if needed

-- For now, let's use a simple approach for admin access
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all profiles"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_current_user_role() TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_current_user_role() TO service_role;
